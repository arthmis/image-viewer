Example:

This has so far only been tested on Windows 10. It would be great if anyone could test
on MacOS to see if there are any issues. 

# IMPORTANT

If you do use this, it should be in a usable state, however you have to replace the 
`IMAGE_FOLDER` value within the main.rs file with a path on your own system. That folder should contain
some images.
